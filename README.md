The quickest way to start hacking on a new React-ES6(and beyond) project!

## Install
Simply clone the repo and run:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Is it working?
After running `npm start` visit localhost:8080
- (this is the default webpack-dev-server port)

If everything is set up properly, you should see a welcome message on the screen that looks like this:

## You're all set!
Start hacking away!

Most of your work will be done inside of `app/js`

If you're new to using React with ES6 you can use the content inside of `app/js/` as an example of how to create ES6 components!

This is a baseline for new React-ES6 projects, add whatever modules you want!

The world is yours!
